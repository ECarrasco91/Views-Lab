In this lab, we will be focusing on creating a simple app. You will practice how to add and modify basic views in an XML layout. Also, using Java, you will practice how to modify views and how to make a view react to a user's click.

## Exercise

#### Requirements

* **Add three buttons**, with the texts "Blue", "Magenta", and "Gray".
* When the buttons are clicked, have each button set the TextView color to the corresponding color.

**Bonus**: Change the background of the text in addition to changing the text's color.

#### Starter code

No starter code is provided.

#### Deliverable
